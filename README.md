This is a simple text based adventure game, create as part of my efforts to achieve an HD at UTAS for the KIT101 unit

Using Java, all aspects of the game are objectified, and the game is designed to allow for item states to be 
persistent within each launch. By this, I mean if an item is picked up in room A and put down in room B, 
when the player returns to room A the item will not be there.

For a better sense of understanding, please feel free to watch the YT tutorial series where each part I cover a 
different part of the Java language, and incrementally build the game as I go.
